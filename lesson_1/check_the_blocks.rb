1.
\'4\' == 4 ? puts(\"TRUE\") : puts(\"FALSE\")
Since string \'4\' isn't eqivalent to integer 4, the condition evaluates to \"FALSE\".

2. 
x = 2
if ((x * 3) / 2) == (4 + 4 - x - 3)
  puts \"Did you get it right?\"
else
  puts \"Did you?\"
end
This prints \"Did you get it right?\" because the expression evaluates to true.

3. 
y = 9
x = 10
if (x + 1) <= (y)
  puts \"Alright.\"
elsif (x + 1) >= (y)
  puts \"Alright now!\"
elsif (y + 1) == x
  puts \"ALRIGHT NOW!\"
end
The only true condition is 11 >= 9, so \"Alright now!\" prints to the screen.
